  d) systemd units
  e) bash

  c) https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Nginx.html?highlight=upstream%20uwsgicluster

This project in up and running state consists of three blockchain nodes running on uwsgi behind nginx, i.e. 127.0.0.1:8080, 127.0.0.1:8081, 127.0.0.1:8082.
To be faster in manipulating with systemctl for these nodes and nginx: bcn.sh and its wrapper.

Feel free to ask any question.
